# Welcome to `This-Repo-Has-x-stars`!
This repository fetches the current stargazers every second and updates the repository name if the stargazer count has changed! There are also milestones, represented with emojis in the repository description, which update every 500 stars. If you're interested in what makes this all work, take a look at ./index.js!
